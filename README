*pymatcher* is a replacement for standard fuzzy matcher provided with CtrlP
because of its performance issues on huge projects. Tested on 350k files.
Some queries causes |CtrlP|'s standard matcher freezes up to 15 seconds. This
matcher provides ~700ms performance on the same hardware with same queries.
Pull requests to improve above performance are much appreciated.
